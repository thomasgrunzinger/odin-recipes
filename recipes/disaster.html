                if you follow these steps you'll be well on your way to a great Recipe for Disaster.
            </p>

        <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 part Impatience (the blinding, reckless kind)</li>
            <li>2 parts Bad Luck (you could make your own, but who has time to make their own luck these days?</li>
            <li>1 part Ignorance (Remember, it's bliss)</li>
            <li>A pinch of Sarcasm</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix parts Impatience and Ignorance together in a haphazard type of way.</li>
            <li>Do not take your time, this is important, a good recipe for this type 
                of disaster involves rushing.</li>
            <li>Now take all of your Bad Luck and whip into the mixture in a smooth motion. 
                In contrast to mixing the Ignorance
                and Impatience, you want the Bad Luck to be mixed in slowly, almost as if 
                it's been there all along.
            </li>
            <li>Add some same Sarcasm as without it, this whole thing could get a little dark.</Li>
            <li>Serve carefully.</li>
        </ol>
